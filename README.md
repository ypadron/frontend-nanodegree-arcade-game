## Description

This game is a version of the classic arcade game Frogger. In this version you, the Player, try to cross the road to the water while avoiding the Enemies (bugs). Use the arrow keys to navigate up, down, left, and right. Beware, the enemies are moving across the paved road at varying speeds, and if the Player collides with an enemy the game is reset, and the Player goes back to the starting position. The Player is safe once you reach the water and the game is over.

## Contributing

This repository is forked from the starter code for _all_ Udacity students, my version of a popular assignment. Therefore, I most likely will not accept pull requests.

==========================================

Students should use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/2696458597/rubric) for self-checking their submission. Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like Player and Enemy) or class prototype functions such as Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions, and that the keyword 'this' is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon. Also be sure that the **readme.md** file is updated with your instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.

For detailed instructions on how to get started, check out this [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v01aScPjSWCCWQLIpFqvg3-vXLH2e8_SZQKC8jNO0Dc/pub?embedded=true).
